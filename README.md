# Pygments VSCode Dark Modern style

A very simple `pygments` plugin adding the default Dark Modern VSCode style.
My goal is to have a consistent coloring when developing in VSC, between the IDE and Python / R(radian) consoles.

## Install

```bash
python -m pip install .
```

## Test

```bash
pygmentize -O style=dark-modern test.py
```

## Contribute

If you want to improve the style to be more consistent with VSCode default Dark Modern, please send a PR.
If you know a Lexer other than the `pygments` default which does a better job, same, please get in touch.
